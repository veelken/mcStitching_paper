\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

The production of MC samples of adequate size is often a challenge in modern HEP experiments,
due to the computing resources required to produce and store such samples.
This is particularly true for experiments at the CERN LHC,
firstly because of the large cross sections of relevant processes (such as DY, $\PW$+jets, and $\Ptop\APtop$+jets production)
and secondly because of the large luminosity delivered by the LHC.

In this paper we have focused on the case that the MC samples have already been produced
and we have presented a procedure that allows to reduce the statistical uncertainties 
by combining MC samples which overlap in PS.
The procedure is based on applying suitably chosen weights to the simulated events.
We refer to the procedure as ``stitching''.

The formalism for computing the stitching weights is general enough to be applied to a variety of use-cases.
When used in physics analyses, the stitching procedure allows to reduce the statistical uncertainties in particular in the tails of distributions.
Examples that document the typical use of the stitching procedure in physics analyses performed by the CMS experiment during LHC Runs $1$ and $2$ have been presented.
We have then presented an extension of the formalism to cover the case of estimating trigger rates at the HL-LHC,
where up to $200$ simultaneous $\Pp\Pp$ collisions are expected per crossing of the proton beams.
The distinguishing feature of this use-case is that the same physics process, 
inelastic $\Pp\Pp$ scattering interactions in which a transverse momentum $\pThat$ is exchanged between the protons,
may occur in the ``hard-scatter'' interaction and in ``pileup'' interactions.
