\subsubsection{Stitching of NLO DY samples by \texorpdfstring{$N_{\jet}$}{Njet}}

This example demonstrates the stitching of an inclusive $\PZggx \to \Plepton\Plepton$ sample simulated at NLO accuracy in pQCD
with exclusive samples produced in slices of jet multiplicity.
The latter are produced for the case of $0$, $1$, and $2$ jets, using the \MGvATNLO commands:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$N_{\jet} = 0$: & \texttt{generate p p > ell+ ell- [QCD]} \\
$N_{\jet} = 1$: & \texttt{generate p p > ell+ ell- j [QCD]} \\
$N_{\jet} = 2$: & \texttt{generate p p > ell+ ell- j j [QCD]} \, ,
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
while the inclusive sample is produced by the commands:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l}
\texttt{generate p p > ell+ ell- [QCD]} \\
\texttt{add process p p > ell+ ell- j [QCD]} \\
\texttt{add process p p > ell+ ell- j j [QCD]} \, .
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

A complication in computing the stitching weights arises from the fact that the jets, represented by the symbol \texttt{j} in the above commands,
refer to quarks and gluons that are present at the Born level, while the samples are generated at NLO accuracy.
The NLO matrix element (ME) that is used to generate the samples contains three different parts, 
corresponding, respectively, to the Born-level, virtual corrections, and the emission of a real gluon.
For events produced by the ME for the Born-level and for the virtual corrections,
the multiplicity of jets on the ME level matches the multiplicity of the symbols \texttt{j} in the above \MGvATNLO commands,
whereas the ME for real gluon emission adds an extra jet at the ME level with respect to the Born level.

We determine the number of jets present at the ME level in a given event by counting the quarks and gluons of status $1$ 
that we find in the \textrm{Les Houches Event} (LHE)~\cite{Alwall:2006yp} file produced by \MGvATNLO.
The complication for computing the stitching weights for the NLO DY samples arises from the fact that only the jet multiplicity at the ME level is stored in the LHE file for the inclusive sample.
We address this complication by determining the probability $P$ that we need for computing the stitching weights according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:weight_incl})
as function of the number of ME-level jets that we find in the LHE file.
Thus, the symbol $i$ that we use to enumerate the different regions in PS
corresponds to the number of jets that are present at the ME level.
We obtain the probabilities $P^{i}$ for the inclusive sample as well as the probabilities $P_{j}^{i}$ for each of the exclusive samples
by plotting the distribution in the number of ME-level jets in the respective sample.
We use the symbols $N_{\jet}^{\ME}$ and $N_{\jet}^{\Born}$ to refer to the number of jets that are present in a given event
at the ME level and at the Born level, respectively.

The number of events contained in each MC sample and the corresponding cross sections are given in Table~\ref{tab:samples_DYJets_vs_Njet}.
The cross sections have been computed at NLO accuracy in pQCD using the program \MGvATNLO
and have been upgraded to NNLO accuracy by scaling them by the ratio of the NNLO to NLO inclusive cross sections.
Numerical values for the probabilities $P^{i}$ and $P_{j}^{i}$ are given in Table~\ref{tab:probabilities_exclusive_DYJets_vs_Njet}.
The stitching weights $w^{i}$, computed according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:weight_incl}), are reported in Table~\ref{tab:weights_DYJets_vs_Njet}.

As we have done for the previous examples, we again compare the distributions in $\pT$ of the leading and subleading jet,
in jet multiplicity and in the observable $\HT$ 
for the inclusive sample to the sum of inclusive plus exclusive samples with the stitching weights applied
to demonstrate that the stitching procedure yields an unbiased background estimate.
The distributions  obtained for the $\PZggx \to \Plepton\Plepton$ samples simulated at NLO accuracy in pQCD are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:controlPlots_DYJets_vs_Njet}.
The distributions agree within the statistical uncertainties.
The figure also shows exclusive samples, distinguished with different fill patterns, stacked together before they are stitched with the inclusive sample.
Below each distribution, we again show the relative statistical uncertainties for the cases that only the inclusive sample is used
and for case that the inclusive and exclusive samples are used.
Compared to using only the inclusive sample,
the samples binned in jet multiplicity reduce the statistical uncertainties by a similar degree 
for the $\PZggx \to \Plepton\Plepton$ samples simulated at NLO accuracy in pQCD 
as was the case for the $\PW \to \Plepton\Pnu$ samples generated at LO accuracy in pQCD,
shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:controlPlots_WJets_vs_Njet} and~\ref{fig:controlPlots_WJets_vs_Njet_and_HT}.
