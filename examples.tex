\section{Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

In this Section, we illustrate the formalism developed in Section~\ref{sec:stitching_weights} with concrete examples,
drawn from two different applications: the modelling of $\PW$+jets production in physics analyses at the LHC
and the estimation of trigger rates at the HL-LHC.
